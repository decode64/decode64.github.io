          Gumroad is a simple e-commerce platform for content creators. It provides a set of tools to simplify the
          process of selling digital products online.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main focus while at Gumroad was to improve the Discover marketplace
          (<a href="https://discover.gumroad.com">discover.gumroad.com</a>) to increase sales and revenue.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Planned and built the improved product placement feature. This feature offered creators the option to pay a
            higher platform fee to rank their product higher in Discover. It was well received by creators,
            contributing to Discover's revenue growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented the redesigned version of Discover. Site navigation, usability, performance, and SEO were
            improved by adding category-specific pages, redesigning the homepage, reorganizing the URL structure,
            rearranging menus and adding navigation breadcrumbs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a new hierarchical product categorization system to allow products to be better organized and
            segmented. Part of the redesigned Discover experience was based on this categorization.
